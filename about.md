Hey hey! My name is Andrei Blokhin and I'm a [junior software developer](https://github.com/xdeath).

## What I do

Basically, I've worked as a junior software developer. I think I know something about .NET, alghorithms, SQL and some other things.


## My plans

I am planning to get my masters degree in an European university and get a job there because I've been thinking about moving somewhere since I was 14 when I visited some European countires for the first time. I also want to continue working on D&D project that I've started to work on with one of my friends.

## Some other plans

I like travelling a lot. I'd like to visit such countries as Japan and USA because I believe that these countries are completely different from others.
I'd also like to learn 3D animation and modeling. I've tried to do some and it was very cool but I want to work with my own models.

_See ya!_
