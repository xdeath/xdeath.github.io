Hey hey! My name is Andrei Blokhin.

## What I do

Basically, I've worked as a junior software developer. I think I know something about .NET, alghorithms, SQL and some other things.


## My plans

I am planning to get my masters degree in an European university and get a job there. I also want to continue working on D&D project that I've started to work on.

## Some other plans

I'd like to learn 3D animation and modeling because I find it really interesting and helpful to boost imagination. I've tried to do some and it was really facinating so now I want to work with my own models.

_See ya!_
